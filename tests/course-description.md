Throughout the EXA844 course lectures we were able to learn some of the core aspects regarding the web programming paradigm, specifically those in which concerns the foundations of front and back-end programming (to-do specify...). 

The course is divided into 3 major sections that composes the core concepts required to develop a basic project. In each of these stages we are inquired to develop a component of of our project.  

The first step is composed by the web crawler, from which we use to acquire the data, whereas the second implies processing and making the data available throughout an API, and the third stage consists of displaying throughout a web application.
